## Overview

Welcome to the **Musée Historique Lausanne - Interactive Map** project! This project was born out of the need to showcase the extensive collection of historical images from the Musée Historique Lausanne (MHL) in a modern, interactive way. The museum lacked a platform to display these images in a geolocalized manner, allowing users to explore Lausanne's rich history through the lens of location.

You can view the live map here: [Interactive Map](https://tgieruc.github.io/Musee-Historique-Lausanne-Carte/).

## About the Project

This web application displays historical images from the Musée Historique Lausanne on an interactive map, allowing users to explore the city of Lausanne through its history. The map uses Leaflet for geospatial visualization and features a range slider to filter images by year.

### Features

- **Interactive Map**: Explore historical images of Lausanne by clicking on map markers.
- **Geolocalization**: Each image is tied to a specific location in Lausanne.
- **Year Filter**: Filter images based on the year they were taken or created.
- **More Information**: Click on an image to view detailed information and access the corresponding page on the museum’s website.

## Motivation

The project was initiated because the Musée Historique Lausanne lacked a digital platform to present its collection in a geolocalized format. By visualizing the museum's data on a map, visitors can engage with the city's history in a more meaningful way.
